# simple-blog-django
This is a very simple blog but it's functional and of course it will be the example for Django developer.
It's semi-CMS. I think It's useful for testers or Devlopers.

**The "first" folder is the main project folder. 

just run appropriate commands and start your webserver:

In linux :
<code>
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
</code>

In windows:
<code>
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
